## Overview

This challenge have been an interesting one as i get to play around using react hook and state management to update the ratings and also using javascript to manipulate the buttons when they are clicked.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
